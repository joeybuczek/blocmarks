##  Blocmarks - Social Bookmarking

ruby 2.1.2p95 Rails 4.1.8

Blocmarks is an online bookmarking service where users can store their favorite urls online.
Bookmarks can be entered in through the site or sent via an email.
Users have the ability to view and like other users' bookmarks.

**While this service is fully functional, Blocmarks is designed for demonstration purposes.**

Testing the service for yourself:

Site URL: [https://joey-blocmarks.herokuapp.com/]

To start using Blocmarks, simply follow the "Sign up" link in the top right corner.
Enter email and password. Once submitted, you'll received a confirmation email for validation.
Once your account is validated, follow the links for the bookmarks at the top.
Bookmarks can also be added via email by using the following information:

**To:** postmaster@appf219fe7feeb54542a364af048cf3fbed.mailgun.org

**Subject:** *Enter the "Topic" name you want the bookmark to be categorized by*

**Body:** *Enter the full url of the site you wish to bookmark*

*Alternatively, you can sign up for the service by sending an email with the above
information, and the site will automatically create a user account. In this case,
the initial password is "password", and for testing purposes, the confirmation 
piece can be skipped.*
